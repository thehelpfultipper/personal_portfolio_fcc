**Objective:**

Create a personal portfolio webpage with this easy-to-follow tutorial for the freeCodeCamp certification. 

Choose from two versions:

1. **Simple header** - Includes basic animation for menu items of border bottom expanding while on hover. 

2. **Advanced header** - Animated logo build from scratch using CSS with slide and scale effects. 

Use CSS Grid to display projects in card tiles and take things up a notch with more hover effects!
